Run program by starting startbot.py

It will create a txt file storing messages input by the user and when 
exiting via the user message "Goodbye", it will also export the stored 
values using the cPickle module to allow quicker load times afterwards.

There is also a profile module that loads statements about the bot's 
self from a profile.txt file. This is similar to the first file except 
this one is referred to when the user message is referring to the bot.
